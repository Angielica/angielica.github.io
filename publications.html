            <p style="text-align: justify;"> In real-world scenario, many phenomena produce a collection of events that occur in continuous time.
              Point Processes provide a natural mathematical framework for modeling these sequences of events. In this survey, we investigate probabilistic models
              for modeling event sequences through temporal processes. We revise the notion of event modeling and provide the mathematical foundations that characterize
              the literature on the topic. We define an ontology to categorize the existing approaches in terms of three families: simple, marked,
              and spatio-temporal point processes. For each family, we systematically review the existing approaches based based on deep learning.
              Finally, we analyze the scenarios where the proposed techniques can be used for addressing prediction and modeling aspects.

            <p style="text-align: justify;"> In recent times, Machine Learning has played an important role in developing novel advanced tools for threat detection and mitigation.
              Intrusion Detection, Misinformation, Malware, and Fraud Detection are just some examples of cybersecurity fields in which Machine Learning techniques are used to reveal the presence of malicious behaviors.
              However, Out-of-Distribution, i.e., the potential distribution gap between training and test set, can heavily affect the performances of the traditional Machine Learning based methods.
              Indeed, they could fail in identifying out-of-samples as possible threats, therefore devising robust approaches to cope with this issue is a crucial and relevant challenge to mitigate the risk of undetected attacks.
              Moreover, a recent emerging line proposes to use generative models to yield synthetic likely examples to feed the learning algorithms.
              In this work, we first survey recent Machine Learning and Deep Learning based solutions to face both the problems, i.e., outlier detection and generation;
              then we illustrate the main cybersecurity application scenarios in which these approaches have been adopted successfully.

            <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"> An increasing number of threat actors takes advantage of information hiding techniques to prevent detection or
              to drop payloads containing attack routines. With the ubiquitous diffusion of mobile appli- cations, high-resolution icons should be considered
              a very attractive carrier for cloaking malicious information via steganographic mechanisms.
              Despite machine learning approaches proven to be effective to detect hidden payloads, the mobile scenario could challenge their deployment
              in realistic use cases, for instance due to scalability constraints. Therefore, this paper introduces an approach based on federated learning
              able to prevent hazards characterizing production-quality scenarios, including different privacy regulations and lack of comprehensive datasets.
              Numerical results indicate that our approach achieves performances similar to those of centralized solutions.

            <p style="text-align: justify;"> Network covert channels are becoming exploited by a wide-range of threats to avoid detection.
              Such offensive schemes are expected to be also used against IoT deployments, for instance to exfiltrate data or to covertly orchestrate botnets composed of simple devices.
              Therefore, we illustrate a solution based on Deep Learning for the detection of covert channels targeting the TTL field of IPv4 datagrams.
              To this aim, we take advantage of an Autoencoder ensemble to reveal anomalous traffic behaviors.
              An experimentation on realistic traffic traces demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

            <p style="text-align: justify;"> We propose ARN, a semisupervised anomaly detection and generation method based on adversarial reconstruction.
             ARN exploits a regularized autoencoder to optimize the reconstruction of variants of normal examples with minimal differences,
             that are recognized as outliers. The combination of regularization and adversarial reconstruction helps to stabilize the learning process,
             which results in both realistic outlier generation and substantial detection capability.
             Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our model improves the current state-of-the-art by valuable margins
             because of its ability to model the true boundaries of the data manifold.
